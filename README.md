# Current Administrator:

Siyu Duan, e-mail: duansiyu@pku.edu.cn

Due to the university's frequent power outages and server maintenance, the platform may not be restarted promptly. If you find that the platform cannot be accessed, don't hesitate to contact the current administrator and we will restart it for you as soon as possible.


# Usage Suggestions

The loading of the functional interface will be slow, but subsequent operations will be fast.

Avoid selecting large amounts of data, which may time out in the transfer of raw text data.

Avoid querying ultra-high-frequency words, such as "之乎者也", in the search and co-occurrence functions. This will cause huge data transmission and timeout.
