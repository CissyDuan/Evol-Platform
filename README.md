Due to the university's frequent power outages and server maintenance, the platform may not be restarted promptly. If you find that the platform cannot be accessed, don't hesitate to contact the current administrator and we will restart it for you as soon as possible.

It is recommended to use mainland China IP and Peking University campus VPN to get faster access speed.
